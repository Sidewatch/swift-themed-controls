import AppKit

/// An `NSScrollView` whose scroller knob follows the app THEME instead of the
/// system appearance.
///
/// AppKit picks the knob's light/dark treatment from the SYSTEM setting, which is
/// the wrong signal here: Sidewatch's theme is chosen independently of it. Run a
/// dark theme under a light system (or the reverse) and the knob is painted for a
/// surface that isn't there — a dark knob on a dark editor, effectively invisible.
///
/// Three native levers, no custom drawing:
///  - `scrollerStyle = .overlay` — the load-bearing one. A LEGACY scroller (system
///    "Show scroll bars: Always", or Automatic with a mouse attached) reserves a
///    solid track strip down the edge; `NSScroller` paints that slot itself, and on
///    a dark theme it reads as a mismatched brown/tan gutter against the content —
///    the artefact the file tree never shows, because the sidebar already forces
///    overlay. Overlay has no reserved track: a floating knob that auto-hides, so
///    every scroll view matches the sidebar's clean edge. (This overrides the system
///    "always show" pref app-wide, a deliberate look choice — the sidebar set the
///    precedent and the whole app now follows it.)
///  - `scrollerKnobStyle` themes the floating knob.
///  - `appearance` pins the knob's light/dark treatment to the THEME, not the system
///    setting — a dark theme under a light system would otherwise paint the knob for
///    a surface that isn't there.
///
/// A custom `NSScroller` subclass that draws its own tinted knob was tried and
/// REVERTED — a flat custom pill looks cheaper than AppKit's shaded, hover-aware
/// native knob, so tinting is a net loss (exactly the trade this note first warned of).

        // wider expanded form — so a split with one auto-hiding pane and one default
        // pane showed two different scroller widths side by side.
