/// Nine lists had written this by hand, and the copies had already drifted three ways with
/// no design intent recorded for most of it: the leading accent bar was 3pt in some, 2pt in
/// one (deliberately — 22pt rows), and absent in five; and `interiorBackgroundStyle` was
/// overridden in some but not others, which decides whether AppKit inverts the row's text
/// on selection. The result was that visually identical lists selected differently.

/// Not `final`: `GitChangeRowView` extends it with hover tracking.
