# Audit log

Last full audit: **17 Sep 2026** — every source file read for the checks below; nothing else needs re-checking
unless it changed after that date. Add a dated line under *History* when you audit again, and keep the
*Known non-issues* list current so the next pass skips them.

## What a full audit checks

1. `swift build` warnings (none allowed except those listed under known non-issues) and `swift test` green.
2. Dead code: every `func`/type/property declared once and referenced nowhere in the app or the family
   (`grep -w` across `*.swift` AND non-Swift files — selectors and MCP names live in strings). Protocol
   requirements, `override`s, `@objc` actions and public API are NOT dead because Sidewatch does not call them.
3. Risky patterns: `Timer` without `invalidate`, `addObserver(forName:)` without `removeObserver`, `as!`, `try!`
   outside literal regexes, `fatalError` outside `init?(coder:)`, `print(` outside harnesses, TODO/FIXME left behind.
4. Docs drift: every name in CLAUDE.md's module map exists; AGENTS.md mirrors CLAUDE.md; README Usage matches the API.

## Result on 17 Sep 2026

- Build: clean. Tests: green.
- Fixed: `AGENTS.md` was a copy of swift-theme-model's; it now mirrors CLAUDE.md.
- Fixed: `ThemedTableHeaderCell` added (band, hairlines, title inset + centring, pressed state, sort indicator) with pixel tests.

## Known non-issues (do not "fix" these again)

- `ThemedCheckbox.allowsVibrancy` shows as unreferenced — it is an `NSView` override AppKit reads.
- Pixel tests sample in POINTS (backing scale) and compare against the palette colour rendered through the same path — never against its hex.

## History

- 17 Sep 2026 — full audit (app + all 20 libraries), Claude with David.
